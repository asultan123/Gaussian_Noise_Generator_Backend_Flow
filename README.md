# Gaussian_Noise_Generator_Backend_Flow

A reference backend flow using Synopsys ICC, Primetime, Formality, Design compiler and the FreePDK45 Tech node. 
Backend flow performed on a gaussian noise generator. The final properties of the design are: 

1) Design produced had clear LVS and DRC with no setup/hold time violationsVoltage 
2) Drop within 2% of nominal at center of design
3) Achieved max clock speed of 275Mhz
4) Area utilization 75% with cell area equal to 27000 micrometers squared
